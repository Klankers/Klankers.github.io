I have a personal bias towards ocean technology. Scientists are not always engineers (and vice versa), which makes multifaceted scientists especially powerful in the current day and age.

##  Cruise Opportunities
Cruises that I know about or are seeking volunteers.

[Insert content here]

### Sporadic
These are some organizations that are usually conducting cruises on varying timescales.

* [The International Ocean Drilling Program](https://www.iodp.org/expeditions/apply-to-sail): The IODP focuses on marine geology, often from a geochronology perspective. These are ships equipped with drills or equipment for working on the seafloor.
* [UNOLS Cruise Volunteer Program](https://www.unols.org/unols-cruise-opportunity-program): UNOLS vessels comprise the majority of ocean research in the United States and the UCVP is a good, centralized place to find cruises that are seeking volunteers for a variety of scientific objectives.

### Annuals
This is a list of known cruises that happen on a yearly or biyearly basis

* [*Okeanos Explorer* Explorer-in-Training Program](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/training.html): Aimed at STEM students with U.S. citizenship. 2/4 or 10 week internships focused on the scientific method or accoustic mapping in the field.
* [OOI Cable Array Cruises](https://oceanobservatories.org/cruise-participation/): Also aimed at STEM students, the OOI services 3 cable arrays: Coastal & Global Scale Nodes (WHOI), Coastal Endurance (OSU), and Regional Cabled Array (UW), which require annual service and generally get ship time with an ROV.
* [Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigation Program](http://www.go-ship.org/Contacts.html): GO-SHIP is one of, if not, the largest international repeat hydrography program. These are month-long cruises focusing on CTD casts and associated subsampling, from salinity to virus counts.
* [The Ocean Exploration Trust Internship Program](https://nautiluslive.org/join/internship-program): Aimed at STEM students, *Nautilus* is renowned for high-tech and innovative exploration of deepwater environments.
* [The NOAA Southwest Fisheries Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/fisheries-resources-division-southwest-fisheries-science-center): Studying the California Current and associated biology, NOAA does a trawl cruise or two every year to investigate fish populations along the coast of California and Baja peninsula.  


##  Job Postings

### Some Job Boards
* The [Marine Technical Society](https://mtsociety.careerwebsite.com/home/index.cfm?) often has postings for techs, mariners, and researchers all around the United States.
* Check out the [RVTEC mailing list](https://www.unols.org/form/contact-us-form) for sea-going technicians.
* [PMEL](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/career-opportunities) is a group with widely-distributed research and development areas.
* [UNOLS](https://www.unols.org/jobs) posts lost of job offers for crew operators, including engineers, cooks, and deck technicians.

##  Conferences

* [AGU](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting) - the largest Earth science conference in the world.
* [Ocean Sciences](https://www.agu.org/ocean-sciences-meeting) - the biggest oceanography-specific meeting.
* [ABGradcon](https://www.abgradcon.org/) - astrobiology conference focusing on graduate students.
* [ABScicon](https://www.agu.org/abscicon) - like AGU, but for astrobiologists.
* [RVTEC](https://www.unols.org/event/meeting/2024-rvtec-meeting) - research vessel technician annual meeting.
* [ESA](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/search?category=events) - the European space agency.
* [Offshore Technology](https://www.otcnet.org/) - Offshore Technology Society, focusing on energy (typically more of a private sector thing).

##  Scholarships

This is mostly oriented towards students in oceanography or engineering.

* The [Marine Technical Society "Student Opportunities" page](https://mtsociety.memberclicks.net/opportunities-for-students) has a variety of scholarships awarded on an annual basis.
