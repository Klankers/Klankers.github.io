##  What I Do

I'm a sea-going data analyst at the [Scripp's Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) in San Diego, California. As a member of the [Oceanographic Data Facility (ODF)](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ships/shipboard-technical-support/odf), I get to sail on a variety of vessels and troubleshoot issues with data acquisition, do data post-processing, and help collect and document scientific samples.

##  My Background

Born and raised in Seattle, I graduated from the University of Washington in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in Oceanography (specializing in [ocean technology](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/story/OTP_Home)), with a minor in applied mathematics. Interested in the ocean tech around [Axial Seamount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_Seamount), I was able to sail on another hydrothermal trip to the [Lost City Vent Field](https://lostcity.biology.utah.edu/) in 2018.

From there, I set off in 2019 for the University of South Carolina to work on a master's studying submarine hydrothermal organic geochemistry. We sailed to the [Mid-Cayman Rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Cayman_Rise) in January of 2020, sampling vent fluids from one of the deepest mafic vent systems in the world. I used those samples to study dissolved organic compounds using gas chromatography, isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance.

With my graduate degree in hand in 2021, I headed back to the west coast to work with the ODF and sail around the world with the goal of providing quality, transparent data to the oceanographic community and funding programs.

##  On The Side

When I'm not out in the field or in front of my screen, I'm most likely out hiking, gaming, or watching movies.
