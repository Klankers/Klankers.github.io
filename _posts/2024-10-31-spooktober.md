'Twas the season. Breaking down some recent spooky media.

These are not all things that I recommend, just things I tried out or rewatched in the spirit of the season. Numbers next to the film are my likeliness to recommend it to fellow fans of spooky stuff.

## Films

Links here are all to the films' respective IMDb pages.

* [*The Autopsy of Jane Doe*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3289956/)

    A solid film and likely a huge inspiration for a great game, *The Mortuary Assistant*. **8 / 10**

* [*Poltergeist*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/)

    Spielberg's (technically Hooper's) attempt at children's horror, which didn't resonate with me. **5 / 10**

* [*Se7en*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/)

    Gritty and grimy, I've seen this one before and enjoyed it even more on a second watch. **8 / 10**

* [*The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072271/)

    A classic for a reason. As a first-timer, this was a lot of fun. **7 / 10**

* [*Tucker and Dale vs. Evil*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1465522/)

    A fun and extremely appropriate palette cleanser from *TCM*. **6 / 10**

* [*Midsommar*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772262/)

    Scandinavian folk horror, though not as effective as *The Wicker Man*. **6 / 10**

* [*Pan's Labyrinth*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/)

    Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. I've seen this many times and I still love Del Toro's dark fantasy. **9 / 10**

* [*Coraline*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327597/)

    Gorgeously directed and animated, it still feels to carry the magic from when I saw it years ago. **8 / 10**

* [*Beetlejuice*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094721/)

    Very fun, with Keaton at his chaotic best and some iconic imagery. **7 / 10**

* [*The Fly*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/)

    Grooooooooooss. Great practical effects which are sooooo grooooooss. **7 / 10**

* [*Signs*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286106/)

    A bland alien invasion film without any effective scares. **4 / 10**

* [*Misery*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100157/)

    An oddly funny adaptation of a Stephen King classic. **6 / 10**

* [*Gremlins*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/)

    To quote a co-worker, *Gremlins* is a lot of things. **6 / 10**

* [*Corpse Bride*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121164/)

    Excluding the skeleton song and dance, *Corpse Bride* literally pales in comparison to *Coraline*. **6 / 10**

* [*The Omen*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075005/)

    Another classic, though this film struggles to compete with the supernatural horror films that preceeded it. **6 / 10**

* [*Nosferatu (1922)*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/)

    My first silent film in over 6 years, *Nosferatu* remains very effective at stirring my imagination. Public domain! **8 / 10**

* [*The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010323/)

    Similarly to *Nosferatu*, *Caligari* builds a wonderful world in my imagination but also layers dense German expressionism on top. Public domain in the US! **7 / 10**

* [*The Silence of the Lambs*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926/)

    A modern classic which I fell asleep to some 10 years ago. This time, I better appreciated the thriller aspects though the horror hasn't gotten to me yet. **8 / 10**

## Games

Links here are all to the games' respective Steam store profiles.

* [*Grunenberg*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2558800/Grunenberg/)

    A brief horror experience which was neither hard nor scary after a half hour. **5 / 10**

* [*Amanda the Adventurer*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2166060/Amanda_the_Adventurer/)

    An obtuse, playable creepypasta with half the intrigue. I didn't realize it was YouTuber bait. **3 / 10**

* [*Visage*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/594330/Visage/)

    Three distinct acts which vacilate wildly in quality and tone for an overall experience that can still be recommended. **7 / 10**

* [*Dread X 3*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1437500/Dread_X_Collection_3/)

    DreadX has slowly been raising the bar, even if the best entries in this pack aren't as memorable as those of the past. **7 / 10**

Overall, my Spooktober was a good one with some gems in there (and I was able to knock out a lot of my watch/play-lists). There are a number of films, games, and books that I didn't get around to, but will certainly be crossed off in the next year or so.
